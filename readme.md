# Updated Portfolio.

Welcome to my updated portfolio, which now boasts actual projects that I have accomplished either alone or in a team thus far in the bootcamp. 

## Motivation  (The How and the Why)

When we first started the bootcamp, this was the first official homework assignment assigned to us. I performed terribly, but I knew where I needed to improve and I was more that determined to make the next time I worked on my portfolio a different experience.

## Tech / Framework Used

Tried out a new javascript function in order for the content below the introduction to appear on the page in a "fade-in" sort of manner.

## Installation

What you are going to want to do is go to my github profile, and then copy my code in one of the three options given that you would prefer, in order to clone my repository to your computer. Then make sure you have
